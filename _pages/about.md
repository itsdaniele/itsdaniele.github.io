Hi ðŸ‘‹ ! I'm Daniele. I am PhD candidate in the [Machine Learning Group](https://mlg.unige.ch) at the University of Geneva, under the supervision of FranÃ§ois Fleuret. My focus is on transformers, LLM systems and efficiency, and alternative architectures.

Recently, I was a research intern at [Cartesia](https://cartesia.ai/) working on multimodal and TTS foundation models (transformers, state space models, linear RNNs) with a strong focus on efficiency.

Previously, I was a researcher at [Together AI](https://www.together.ai/) supervised by [Tri Dao](https://tridao.me/), where I worked on LLM distillation, efficient inference, and developed speculative decoding for Mamba/linear RNNs.

In a previous life, I have worked as a software engineer, I have done machine learning at [Truelayer](https://truelayer.com/), and I have played in [Capture the Flag competitions](https://theromanxpl0it.github.io/).

I also love sailing, reading, writing fiction, cooking and playing guitar.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DanielePaliotta), or find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniele-paliotta-455139a2/).
