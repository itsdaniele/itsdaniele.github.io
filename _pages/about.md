Hi ðŸ‘‹ ! My name is Daniele. I am PhD student in the [Machine Learning Group](https://mlg.unige.ch) at the University of Geneva, under the supervision of FranÃ§ois Fleuret.  

Currently, I am a Research Scientist intern at [Cartesia AI](https://cartesia.ai/) (San Francisco, USA, March 2025 â€“ June 2025), working on multimodal and TTS foundation models (transformers, state space models, linear RNNs) with a strong focus on efficiency.

Previously, I was a Research Scientist intern at [Together AI](https://www.together.ai/) (Remote, April 2024 â€“ ongoing), supervised by [Tri Dao](https://tridao.me/), where I led efforts on LLM distillation, efficient inference, and developed speculative decoding for Mamba/linear RNNs.

In a previous life, I have worked as a software engineer, I have done machine learning at [Truelayer](https://truelayer.com/), and I have played in [Capture the Flag competitions](https://theromanxpl0it.github.io/).

I am also a triathlete, an avid reader, and a guitar player.
