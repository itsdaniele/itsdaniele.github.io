Hi ðŸ‘‹ ! My name is Daniele. I am PhD student in the [Machine Learning Group](https://mlg.unige.ch) at the University of Geneva, under the supervision of FranÃ§ois Fleuret. 
I am also an aspiring triathlete, an avid reader, and a not-good-anymore guitar player.
You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DanielePaliotta) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/daaniaele/).
